while installing agent+helper helm we are getting errors on Notes.txt file complaining on the ingress object. As notes.txt can be rendered we would like to delete notes.txt from helm template and test it. Also we saw agent+helper cannot be deployed alone as it is jst a library we will now be deploying agent hem along with the agent+helper as the dependency object.
